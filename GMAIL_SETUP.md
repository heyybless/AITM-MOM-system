## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Use App Password, NOT your regular Gmail password**
- **The App Password is 16 characters long**
- **2-Factor Authentication must be enabled first**
- **Remove spaces from App Password if copying with spaces**

## üß™ Verification

After setup, you should see:
```
üìß Email service configured successfully
```

And when creating meetings, you'll see:
```
üìß Meeting invitation emails sent to: user@example.com
```

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

**"Username and Password not accepted"**
- You're using regular password instead of App Password
- Generate a new App Password and try again

**"Less secure app access"**
- This doesn't apply to App Passwords
- App Passwords bypass less secure app restrictions

**Still having issues?**
- Run the interactive setup: `node setup-email.js`
- It will test your configuration and provide specific error messages
